Notes:

Currently you can run the workflow "locally" by running it from the /src
However, when run from root it will try to run on K8s which fails due to 
a storage problem. This is to be expected because a fusion S3 filesystem
has not been configured yet.

- Implement a storage solution for the K8s cluster
    - Set up Minio if possible for local testing (might need a bigger VM)
- Test the workflow on the K8s cluster
- Try to implement a more complex workflow
- Try to implement a workflow which runs in a container
